# mediatools
A Docker container of my favorite media tools I use with video

Included in the container is:

 - `exiftool` - Useful to look at the metadata for the file 
 - `mediainfo` - Useful to look at encoding, fps, etc for the file
 - `ffmpeg` - Useful to do encoding or other modifications to the file
